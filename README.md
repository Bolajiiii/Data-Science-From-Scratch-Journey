# Data-Science-From-Scratch-Journey
Implementing data science from scratch using Python.


This repository tracks my journey through the foundational concepts of Data Science.

## My Key Learning Objectives
**Mathematical Intuition**: Strengthening my understanding of Statistics, Probability, and Linear Algebra.

**Algorithmic Thinking**: Mastering the logic behind Gradient Descent, Regression models, and Neural Networks.

**Data Ethics**:Understanding how outliers and bias influence results.

## My Roadmap
*The first two chapters focus on introductory concepts. While they are essential for building intuition, they do not naturally translate into standalone portfolio projects. Therefore, I will be starting from Chapter 3.*

**Chapter 3** - When Data Visualization Lies (In progress)
