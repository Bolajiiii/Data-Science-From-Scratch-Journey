# Chapter 4: The Geometry of Data 
## Overview
In this chapter, I explore the ways in which data can be interpreted geometrically using vectors and linear algebra.
Through creating vector operations, I explor-e the role of distance, direction, and magnitude in how we measure relationships in data.

## Core Question
What changes when we represent data as points in space instead of isolated values?

## Data Source
