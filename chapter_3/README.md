## Chapter 3: When Data Visualization Lies

# Overview
This project dives into how the way we show data can change how people see it, even when the numbers themselves don't change.

I run through examples where tiny tweaks in visualization (like changing axis scales, picking different histogram bins, or filtering certain data) can make trends look different than they actually are. 

# Core question
How easy is it to trick someone with just a few visual tweaks?

# My Projects
* [**01_truncated_axis.ipynb**](./01_truncated_axis.ipynb) : This demonstrates how manipulating the Y-axis range can exaggerate small trends.

* [**02_bin_manipulation.ipynb**](./02_bin_manipulation.ipynb) : This demonstrates how changing the width of bins in histograms can affect how we view data.

* [**03_correlation_illusion.ipynb**](./03_correlation_illusion.ipynb):
This demonstrates how cherry picking specific data subsets can hide strong negative correlations.
